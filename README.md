# Reflection_Paragraph
When I joined this class I was excited to branch out from my basic understanding of data analytics through my R background, and to really break into the data scene heading into college. But the sheer amount of knowledge I will retain from this class is unlike any other I have taken before. Not only am I becoming a master of a multitiude of languages, I am more than capable now of being able to present a very exciting dataset to a room of people who do not know what all the numbers mean at face value. The skills I will take away from this class include but are not limited to what I was hoping for going into it- I can utilize data in my toolbelt like I never thought I could, from a team aspect to a client meeting, whatever I need to do with the data I feel comfortable handling it now.
